  <h2>About Treaty</h2>
    <img src="/64242453_10157336717763142_9082343839343050752_o.jpg" height="400" width="600">
    <p>I was born in Detroit, Michigan on August 20, 1953. My mother told me that when I was a baby, I used to wake in the middle of the night and sing and bang on the edges of my crib. My father started myself and my brother with piano lessons when I was 8 years old. I didn't like the piano, so I stopped playing; when I went to middle school, and was introduced to other instruments, I liked and decided to play the flute. 
    <p>My father took me to Ford Auditorium to see Nina Simone and also snuck me into the Blue Bird Lounge, where I was able to see renowned musicians like Miles Davis, Dexter Gordon, and Kenny Burrell. 
    <p>I also became a part of school events competitions and talent shows. At that time, I realized that most bands, trios, and the like were not hiring flute players. When I was around 16 years old, my father had a conga drum and a set of bongos. I asked my band teacher if I could take up the drums but I was told that it wasn't a "lady-like instrument" and that they wouldn’t let me learn how to play them. 
    <p>I became very angry. To prove them wrong, I started playing congas and bongos and practiced 8 to 10 hours everyday. Soon after, I was introduced to a <strong>dancer named Clifford Fears</strong> who danced for the <strong>Katherine Dunham Dance Company</strong>. Clifford trained me to be a conga player for his company and, around this time, I played with the <strong>Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater</strong>, as well.
    <p>Clifford's studio just happened to be across the street from <strong>Hitsville U.S.A.</strong>, the recording studio where groups like <strong>The Temptations</strong> and <strong>The Supremes</strong> also practiced. There, I met the bassist <strong>James Jamerson</strong>, <strong>"Bongo" Eddie</strong>, and the <strong>Motown drummers Pistol Allen</strong> and <strong>Uriel Jones</strong>. I wasn't allowed to record with them since I wasn't accomplished enough at the time, but I followed and toured with them around Detroit and played in spaces like the <strong>Chit Chat Lounge</strong>, <strong>The 20 Grand</strong>, and the <strong>Flame Show Bar</strong>. With them, I learned how to play jazz, R&B, and the like.
    <p>My first on-the-road gig was with <strong>Kim Weston</strong> opening for <strong>Ramsey Lewis</strong>: I got paid $500 and thought that I was rich. Soon afterwards, I had a tragic accident, where I stuck my hand through a glass door and cut the tendon in my thumb. I was 19 at the time and a hand specialist said that I would never play again. Of course, I barked right back at them that I was definitely going to play again because that was all I knew how to do. After a recovery time of about two years, I began to gig again around Detroit.
    <p>After these two years, from 1972 - 1979, I met a female guitar player named <strong>Pearl</strong>, who lived next door to Sharon Hicks (whose brother, Rod Hicks, was the bassist for Aretha Franklin). I also played in a band with my schoolmate Norma Jean Bell in a band called the <strong>Evil Eye</strong>.</p>
    <p>I also played with Detroit locals <strong>Buddy Budon</strong> and <strong>Gary Schunk</strong> in a band called <strong>Wavelength</strong>. In 1975, I met <strong>Belita Wood</strong>. Belita had a contract with <strong>Barrett Strong</strong>, the first artist to record a hit for Motown. I started to play with bands she was gigging with and, soon, Belita and I became extremely close. As a result of our friendship, we started writing songs together, at first just for fun. Belita was also working with <strong>Chuck Overton</strong> at the time and, together, they formed a group called <strong>Brainstorm</strong> and asked me to join. Well, he soon started singing very frequently all over the state and became extremely popular. 
    <p>We started looking to get a record deal. We were introduced to a man named <strong>Clarence Avant, who signed us to his brand new label Tabu Records</strong>. We went to Los Angeles and were supposed to be produced by <strong>Charles Stepney</strong>, who was the produer for <strong>Earth, Wind & Fire</strong>. The very day we arrived at LA, however, <strong>Charles Stepney</strong> passed away. We were good writers and wrote all of our own songs, so Clarence decided to hire a producer, Jerry Peters, who unfortunately didn't understand our band and what we wanted to accomplish as artists.
    <p>Around this time, Belita and I wrote a song called <strong>"Lovin' Is Really My Game"</strong>: Belita wrote the lyrics and I wrote the music. The year was 1977 and disco music and disco clubs were extremely popular, so they turned my R&B song into a disco song. It was in the movie Studio 54, where we also happened to play. <strong>We sold 1,000,000 copies worldwide</strong>. We toured all over the United States and opened for Barry White, Marvin Gaye, The Jacksons, Maze, Bootsy Collins, Teddy Pendergrass, and The Isley Brothers. 
    <p>Recently, I've played with <strong>Ralph Armstrong</strong>, where we <strong>opened for Kenny G at the at the Aretha Franklin Amipitheatre in Detroit</strong>, and concerts with the <strong>great bassist John Patituchi</strong> and <strong>drummer Terri Lyne Carrington</strong>, and a host of other great entertainers and musicians.
