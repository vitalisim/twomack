    <p>I was born in Detroit, Michigan on August 20, 1953. My mother told me that when I was a baby, I used to wake in the middle of the night and sing and bang on the edges of my crib. My father started myself and my brother with piano lessons when I was 8 years old. I didn't like the piano, so I stopped playing; when I went to middle school, and was introduced to other instruments, I liked and decided to play the flute. 
    <p>My father took me to Ford Auditorium to see Nina Simone and also snuck me into the Blue Bird Lounge, where I was able to see renowned musicians like Miles Davis, Dexter Gordon, and Kenny Burrell. 
    <p>I also became a part of school events competitions and talent shows. At that time, I realized that most bands, trios, and the like were not hiring flute players. When I was around 16 years old, my father had a conga drum and a set of bongos. I asked my band teacher if I could take up the drums but I was told that it wasn't a "lady-like instrument" and that they wouldn’t let me learn how to play them. 
    <p>I became very angry. To prove them wrong, I started playing congas and bongos and practiced 8 to 10 hours everyday. Soon after, I was introduced to a dancer named Clifford Fears who danced for the Katherine Dunham Dance Company. Clifford trained me to be a conga player for his company and, around this time, I played with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, as well.
    <p>Clifford's studio just happened to be across the street from Hitsville U.S.A., the recording studio where groups like The Temptations and The Supremes also practiced. There, I met the bassist James Jamerson, "Bongo" Eddie, and the Motown drummers Pistol Allen and Uriel Jones. I wasn't allowed to record with them since I wasn't accomplished enough at the time, but I followed and toured with them around Detroit and played in spaces like the Chit Chat Lounge, The 20 Grand, and the Flame Show Bar. With them, I learned how to play jazz, R&B, and the like.
    <p>My first on-the-road gig was with Kim Weston opening for Ramsey Lewis: I got paid $500 and thought that I was rich. Soon afterwards, I had a tragic accident, where I stuck my hand through a glass door and cut the tendon in my thumb. I was 19 at the time and a hand specialist said that I would never play again. Of course, I barked right back at them that I was definitely going to play again because that was all I knew how to do. After a recovery time of about two years, I began to gig again around Detroit.
    <p>After these two years, from 1972 - 1979, I met a female guitar player named Pearl, who lived next door to Sharon Hicks (whose brother, Rod Hicks, was the bassist for Aretha Franklin). I also played in a band with my schoolmate Norma Jean Bell in a band called the Evil Eye.</p>
    <p>I also played with Detroit locals Buddy Budon and Gary Schunk in a band called Wavelength. In 1975, I met Belita Wood. Belita had a contract with Barrett Strong, the first artist to record a hit for Motown. I started to play with bands she was gigging with and, soon, Belita and I became extremely close. As a result of our friendship, we started writing songs together, at first just for fun. Belita was also working with Chuck Overton at the time and, together, they formed a group called Brainstorm and asked me to join. Well, he soon started singing very frequently all over the state and became extremely popular. 
    <p>We started looking to get a record deal. We were introduced to a man named Clarence Avant, who signed us to his brand new label Tabu Records. We went to Los Angeles and were supposed to be produced by Charles Stepney, who was the produer for Earth, Wind & Fire. The very day we arrived at LA, however, Charles Stepney passed away. We were good writers and wrote all of our own songs, so Clarence decided to hire a producer, Jerry Peters, who unfortunately didn't understand our band and what we wanted to accomplish as artists.
    <p>Around this time, Belita and I wrote a song called "Lovin' Is Really My Game": Belita wrote the lyrics and I wrote the music. The year was 1977 and disco music and disco clubs were extremely popular, so they turned my R&B song into a disco song. It was in the movie Studio 54, where we also happened to play. We sold 1,000,000 copies worldwide. We toured all over the United States and opened for Barry White, Marvin Gaye, The Jacksons, Maze, Bootsy Collins, Teddy Pendergrass, and The Isley Brothers. 
    <p>Recently, I've played with Ralph Armstrong, where we opened for Kenny G at the at the Aretha Franklin Amipitheatre in Detroit, and concerts with the great bassist John Patituchi and drummer Terri Lyne Carrington, and a host of other great entertainers and musicians.
